And none has forced businesses throughout the world to accelerate their evolution as their leaders worked to respond and recover on the way to thriving in the postpandemic environment.

Deloitte Private‚Äôs latest global survey of private enterprises reveals that executives in every region used the crisis as a catalyst, accelerating change in virtually all aspects of how we work and live. They stepped up their digital transformation through greater technology investment and deployment. In-progress initiatives were pushed toward completion, while those that were on the drawing board came to life. They sought out new partnerships and alliances. They pursued new opportunities to strengthen their supply networks and grow markets. They increased efforts to understand their purpose beyond profits, seeking new ways to grow sustainably and strengthen trust with their employees, customers, and other key stakeholders. They also embraced new possibilities in how and where work gets done.

OBQA_CONTEXT = """Large Language Models
Introduction to the core of our product

Natural language processing (NLP) has seen rapid growth in the last few years since large language models (LLMs) were introduced. Those huge models are based on the Transformers architecture, which allowed for the training of much larger and more powerful language models.
We divide LLMs into two main categories, Autoregressive and Masked LM (language model). In this page we will focus on Autoregressive LLMs, as our language models, Jurassic-1 series, belongs to this category.

‚ö° The task: predict the next word
Autoregressive LLM is a neural network model composed from billions of parameters. It was trained on a massive amount of texts with one goal: to predict the next word, based on the given text. By repeating this action several times, every time adding the prediction word to the provided text, you will end up with a complete text (e.g. full sentences, paragraphs, articles, books, and more). In terms of terminology, the textual output (the complete text) is called a completion while the input (the given, original text) is called prompt.

üéì Added value: knowledge acquisition
Imagine you had to read all of Shakespeare's works repeatedly to learn a language. Eventually, you would be able to not only memorize all of his plays and poems, but also imitate his writing style.
In similar fashion, we trained the LLMs by supplying them with many textual sources. This enabled them to gain an in-depth understanding of English as well as general knowledge.

üó£Ô∏è Interacting with Large Language Models
The LLMs are queried using natural language, also known as prompt engineering. 
Rather than writing lines of code and loading a model, you write a natural language prompt and pass it to the model as the input.

‚öôÔ∏è Resource-intensive
Data, computation, and engineering resources are required for training and deploying large language models. LLMs, such as our Jurassic-1 models, play an important role here, providing access to this type of technology to academic researchers and developers.

Tokenizer & Tokenization

Now that you know what large language models are, you must be wondering: ‚ÄúHow does a neural network use text as input and output?‚Äù.

The answer is: Tokenization üß©
Any language can be broken down into basic pieces (in our case, tokens). Each of those pieces is translated into its own vector representation, which is eventually fed into the model. For example:
Each model has its own dictionary of tokens, which determines the language it "speaks". Each text in the input will be decomposed into these tokens, and every text generated by the model will be composed of them.
But how do we break down a language? Which pieces are we choosing as our tokens? There are several approaches to solve this:

üî° Character-level tokenization
As a simple solution, each character can be treated as its own token. By doing so, we can represent the entire English language with just 26 characters (okay, double it for capital letters and add some punctuation). This would give us a small token dictionary, thereby reducing the width we need for those vectors and saving us some valuable memory. However, those tokens don‚Äôt have any inherent meaning - we all know what the meaning of ‚ÄúCat‚Äù is, but what is the meaning of ‚ÄúC‚Äù? The key to understanding language is context. Although it is clear to us readers that a "Cat" and a "Cradle" have different meanings, for a language model with this tokenizer - the "C" is the same.

üÜí Word-level tokenization
Another approach we can try is breaking our text into words, just like in the example above ("I want to break free").
Now, every token has a meaning that the model can learn and use. We are gaining meaning, but that requires a much larger dictionary. Also, it raises another question: what about words stemming from the same root-word like ‚Äùhelped‚Äù, ‚Äúhelping‚Äù, and ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù? In this approach each of these words will get a different token with no inherent relation between them, whereas for us readers it's clear that they all have a similar meaning.
Furthermore, words may have fundamentally different meanings when strung together - for instance, my run-down car isn't running anywhere. What if we went a step further?

üí¨ Sentence-level tokenization
In this approach we break our text into sentences. This will capture meaningful phrases! However, this would result in an absurdly large dictionary, with some tokens being so rare that we would require an enormous amount of data to teach the model the meaning of each token.

üèÖ Which is best?
Each method has pros and cons, and like any real-life problem, the best solution involves a number of compromises. AI21 Studio uses a large token dictionary (250K), which contains some from every method: separate characters, words, word parts such as prefixes and suffixes, and many multi-word tokens."""
